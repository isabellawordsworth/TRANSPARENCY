Transparency, full and complete transparency is the unltimate goal in our consumer based economy.



TRANSPERENCY IS THE WORLDS MOST SACRED COMMODITY.

It's coveted.

It's treasured.

It's a facade.

Let's be honest, do you actually shop based on ethical transparency, or even basic supply chain transparency?
