Transparency, full and complete transparency is the unltimate goal in our consumer based economy.



TRANSPERENCY IS THE WORLDS MOST SACRED COMMODITY.

It's coveted.

It's treasured.

It's a facade.

Let's be honest, do you actually shop based on ethical transparency, or even basic supply chain transparency?
Would you change your buying habits if you knew?
Would you change your habits even if you had to give up technology that is central to your life and your routine?

Out of the statements only 18% of the tech companies were in line with the minimum requirements and standards of labor. 
Apple hired anonymous experts to research the suicide nets that are outside their manufacturing building.

These academic studies are one Google search away, but at the same time completely inaccessible. They use overly complex language, expensive fee's to purchase the studies. It's exclusionary, no wonder we as a collective cannot put the pressure on complete and total transparency.

_“After work, the employer locks usin the hostel. Every week he just chooses a few of us to go out to the market for a few hours, then back to the hostel. The guard supervises us closely. We can’t go out; if we don’t listen to him, he will beat us.”_ (Verité (2014), p. 124)
